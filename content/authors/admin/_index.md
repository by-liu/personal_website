I am a Research Associate at [ETS Montreal](https://www.etsmtl.ca/), Canada.
I work at the [Laboratoire d’Imagerie, de Vision et d’Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA)](https://liviamtl.ca/), under the supervision of [Prof. Ismail Ben Ayed](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/ibenayed/) and [Prof. Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io/).
My current research field is Computer Vision and its application in Medical Image Analysis.

Previously, I obtained advanced industrial experiences (R&D for real products), as I worked for several companies ([Coohom](https://www.coohom.com), Alibaba, etc.) from 2015 to 2020.
I got my Ph.D at Institue of Automatoin, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015, where my supervisors were [Prof. Hanqing Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lWtoko4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Jing Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sOI-S7oAAAAJ&hl=en).
I received my BSc from Zhejiang University in 2010.

Besides tech stuff, I have passion in sports, reading and travel.
